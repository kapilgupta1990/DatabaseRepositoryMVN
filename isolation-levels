The isolation levels specified by the SQL standard are as follows:

Serializable  --> usually ensures serializable execution. However, as we shall

manner that may, in certain cases, allow nonserializable executions.


Repeatable read->

Read commited ->


Read uncommited- >



Many database systems run, by default, at the read-committed isolation level.
